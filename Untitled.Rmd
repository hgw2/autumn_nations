This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(rvest)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
webpage <- read_html("https://www.rugbypass.com/live/autumn-nations-cup/england-vs-georgia-at-twickenham-on-14112020/2020/stats/")

tabls_ls <- webpage %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>% 
  .[1:10] %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE)

blank_table <- empty_tibble()
for(table in tabls_ls)

```
