This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
webpage <- read_html("https://www.rugbypass.com/live/autumn-nations-cup/ireland-vs-wales-at-aviva-stadium-on-13112020/2020/stats/")

headings <- get_tbl_headings(webpage)

home_team <- get_home_team_tbl(webpage, headings)

away_team <- get_away_team_tbl(webpage, headings) %>% 
  mutate(across(try_scored:yellow_card, as.numeric))

```

```{r}
url <- "https://www.rugbypass.com/live/autumn-nations-cup/england-vs-georgia-at-twickenham-on-14112020/2020/stats/"

match <- str_remove(url, "https://www.rugbypass.com/live/autumn-nations-cup/")
match <- str_remove(match, "/2020/stats/")

date <- str_extract(url, "[0-9]{8}")

match <- str_extract(url,"[a-z-]+[0-9]{8}") %>% 
  str_replace_all("-", "_") %>% 
  str_extract("[a-z_]+(?=_at)")
```
